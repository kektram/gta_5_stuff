# gta_5_stuff
Various resources for gta 5.

## Kek's Object Mapper
> Contains an extended list of objects.

> It has objects that are only streamable in certain areas of gta 5.

> I've filtered out a lot of garbage, such as LODS and SLODS.

> All objects in the table "model_names" are streamable anywhere in gta 5.

> The 2 other tables of objects, contain only objects that you need to be in specific places for them to be "valid".

> This list was last updated 3 months ago. [gta 1.63]
